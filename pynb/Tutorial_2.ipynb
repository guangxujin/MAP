    "\n",
    "The identified strength scores, $\\mathbf{S}_{\\wp(\\mathbf{\\Omega}) }$, based on Pareto dominance, represent to what extent the single cells in the POF are exhausted in the context of all MICs and TFs. For the application of PO model to the CyTOF data, $\\mathbf{S}_{\\wp(\\mathbf{\\Omega}) }$ were derived from a 6$-$dimensional expression space defined by the markers. Since the strength score vector, $\\mathbf{S}_{\\wp(\\mathbf{\\Omega}) }$, considers multiple checkpoints and TFs, the exhaustion represented by $\\mathbf{S}_{\\wp(\\mathbf{\\Omega}) }$ is called overall CD8Tex. \n",
    "\n",
    "To show the relationship between each marker and the overall CD8Tex, we defined three quantitative values at sample level for each marker. These three quantitative values were derived from two vectors in the 6$-$dimensional expression space. One is the strength score vector, $\\mathbf{S}_{\\wp(\\mathbf{\\Omega}) }$, and the other is the expression levels of a marker $i$, $\\mathbf{E}_i$, of the single cells in the POF, $\\wp(\\mathbf{\\Omega})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### POF angle\n",
    "The first quantitative value is the angle between these two vectors, that is, $\\theta_i$, which is termed by POF angle (\\textbf{Fig.1c,2a, Methods}). The POF angle determines how sensitive the marker is in regulating overall exhaustion. If the overall CD8Tex can be represented by an individual marker, the angle is close to zero degree. \n",

POF expression is used to describe CD8Tex by one marker at sample level. \n",

Projecting the POF expression value, $d(\\mathbf{E}_i)$, of marker $i$ to $\\mathbf{S}_{\\wp(\\mathbf{\\Omega}) }$, by the POF angle, $\\theta_i$, defines the POF projected expression value, $p(\\mathbf{E}_i)$, of this marker.
